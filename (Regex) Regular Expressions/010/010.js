// Regexs can be used to find and match all sort of things, from urls to filenames

// HOWEVER! be careful if you try to use regexs for really complex tasks, such as parsing emails 

// (which get really confusing, really fast), or HTML (which is not a regular language, and so can't be fully parsed by a regular expression)

// There is (of course) much more to regex like lazy vs greedy, lookahead, and capturing

// but most of what web developers want to do with regular expressions can use just these base building blocks.

// I'm already writing a follow up post with a bunch of real world regex use cases ðŸŽ‰
